# Paperback Extensions

A repository of community manga/manhua/comic extensions for
[Paperback](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app) **v0.9**.

Sources are converted from the
[keiyoushi Tachiyomi extensions](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions-source).
Each upstream theme framework (Madara, MangaThemesia, Keyoapp, Iken, MangaHub,
HeanCms, ZeistManga, MMRCMS, and many more) is reimplemented once as a shared
TypeScript template, and every source built on that framework is generated from
it. A number of sources that don't share a framework (e.g. LikeManga, Mangago,
WeebCentral, MangaPill, MangaFreak, MangaKatana, Manga Demon, TCB Scans, Flame
Comics) are fully self-contained.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Not all sources have been tested.** These extensions are plain conversions
> of the keiyoushi Tachiyomi extensions, so while many work, some may be broken,
> incomplete, or out of date. If you find a source that isn't working, please
> [open an issue](../../issues) describing the problem (source name, what you
> did, and what went wrong). I maintain this in my spare time, so I'll get to
> fixes when I have free time — thanks for your patience and for helping improve
> the repository.

> [!NOTE]
> **Only sources that already exist in keiyoushi will be added here.** This
> repository is a port of the keiyoushi Tachiyomi extensions, not a place for
> brand-new sources. If a source exists in keiyoushi but isn't available here
> yet, please [open an issue](../../issues) to request it and I'll work on
> converting it.

### Features

- **Discover, search, details, chapters and pages** for every source.
- **Search sorting** — frameworks that support server-side ordering expose a
  sort dropdown (e.g. Madara: Relevance, Latest, A-Z, Rating, Trending, Most
  Views, New).
- **Advanced search filters** — author, artist, release year, status, type,
  adult content, genre condition, etc., depending on what the upstream
  framework supports.
- **Per-source settings** — every source has a settings form with a
  **base-URL override**, so you can point it at a new domain if the site moves
  without waiting for an update. Some frameworks add extra toggles (e.g.
  "show locked/paid chapters", "show adult content", image quality, a separate
  API-URL override).
- **Cloudflare challenge handling** via the bypass interceptor.
- **Source badges** in the extension list (the framework name, e.g. `Madara`,
  `Iken`, `MangaHub`, plus `Mature` for NSFW sources).

## Installation

### One-tap (recommended)

On the device that has Paperback (v0.9 or newer) installed, open the
installation page and tap **Add Repository to Paperback**, then confirm the
prompt:

**https://nicartjay.github.io/PaperbackExt/0.9/stable/**

The page lists every source — you can also tap individual sources and use the
**Install** button to add just the ones you want.

### Manual

If the one-tap link doesn't work, add the repository by hand:

1. Open Paperback (v0.9 or newer).
2. Go to **Settings → Extensions → Add Repository**.
3. Paste this URL:

   ```
   https://nicartjay.github.io/PaperbackExt/0.9/stable/
   ```

4. Install the sources you want and enjoy reading.

> Some sources sit behind Cloudflare. The first time you open them
> Paperback may show a Cloudflare challenge in a webview — solve it once and
> the cookies are stored for subsequent requests.

### Changing a source's domain

If a site moves to a new domain, open the source's **settings** (gear icon on
the source page) and set a **Base URL override**. The source will use your
override instead of the built-in domain until you reset it. Self-hosted
frameworks (e.g. Monochrome Custom, Bakkin Self-hosted) rely on this to point at
your own server.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — anyone can help fix a broken source or keep sources
up to date. You don't need write access; just fork the repo, make your change,
and open a pull request against `0.9/stable`. See
**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full workflow (project layout,
version bumping, type-checking, and the stray-`.js` cleanup step).

If you've found a broken source but can't fix it yourself, please
[open an issue](../../issues) — a source name, the exact error, and an HTTP log
(Charles/Pulse) help a lot.

## Frameworks

The repository implements **25 shared theme frameworks** plus standalone
sources. Each framework lives under `src/utils/<framework>/` and is reused by
every source built on it.

## Available Sources

**418** sources are currently published. Sources marked **Mature** contain
adult/NSFW content (225 Mature, 193 Everyone).

The lists below group sources by manual testing status. **Tested** sources
have been verified working on a device. **Not yet tested** sources are plain
keiyoushi conversions that haven’t been checked yet (they may or may not
work). **Can’t test** sources can’t be verified right now — either they need
an account or credentials I don’t have, or the site itself is currently down.
If a source is broken, please open an issue.

### ⚠️ Can’t test (8)

These can’t be verified right now — they need credentials I don’t have, or the
site is currently down.

| Source | Version | Content | Note |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| Arc-Relight | 1.4.16.1 | Everyone | Server down — arc-relight.com’s TLS certificate expired (Jun 22, 2026; Let’s Encrypt E7). iOS rejects the handshake (NSURLErrorDomain -1200 / errSSLClosedAbort -9802); curl/openssl confirm “certificate has expired”. Affects all clients, not just Paperback. Will re-test once the cert is renewed. |
| BeeHentai | 1.4.24.4 | Mature | Server down — beehentai.com HTTPS origin is unresponsive (Cloudflare connects but the origin never replies). Affects all clients, not just Paperback. Will re-test when the site is back. |
| Madokami | 1.4.16.1 | Everyone | Needs HTTP Basic account credentials. |
| MangaReader.in | 1.4.6.1 | Mature | Images down — the site delivers every cover and page through its own server-side proxy (`mangareader.in/imgs/<base64>`), which times out (HTTP 500 `cURL error 28`) when its upstream CDNs (`h2.manimg24.com`, `harimanga.me`) are unreachable. Those origins return Cloudflare 522 directly. Parsing/selectors verified correct (reachable images load fine via the same path); affects all clients, not just Paperback. Will re-test when the image origins recover. |
| NineAnime | 1.4.6.1 | Mature | Site dead — www.nineanime.com (the baseUrl, same as upstream keiyoushi) 302-redirects every request, including the discover endpoint `/category/index_1.html?sort=views`, to a parked domain (`popgo.cc/game/word/`). Affects all clients, not just Paperback. Will re-test if the site returns. |
| Toonily.me | 1.4.4.1 | Mature | Re-platformed upstream — the source moved off MadTheme onto the new shared **MangaK** theme and its domain changed from `toonily.me` to `toontop.io`. Both `toontop.io` and its `api.toontop.io` search endpoint answer every non-browser request with Cloudflare HTTP 403 (`Just a moment…`), so the port can only be exercised through Paperback's Cloudflare bypass on-device. Will re-test once verified on a device. |
| VyvyManga.org | 1.4.52.1 | Mature | Server down — vyvymanga.org returns Cloudflare 521 (web server is down). Affects all clients, not just Paperback. Will re-test when the site is back. |
| XOXO Comics | 1.4.13.5 | Everyone | Images unavailable to headless clients — every chapter page image is self-hosted on xoxocomic.com (`/comic/<slug>/<issue>/<id>/<n>.jpg`) but those URLs return HTTP 200 with a ~106 KB HTML "404!" reader page instead of image bytes for any non-browser request (verified across iOS/Googlebot UAs, image-only Accept, with/without referer/cookies). The site gates page images behind JS/Cloudflare/adblock detection, so Paperback can never retrieve them. Affects all headless clients. |

## Project Layout

```
src/
  <SourceName>/
    main.ts        # source instance (usually a small config one-liner)
    pbconfig.ts    # extension manifest (name, version, content rating, ...)
    static/
      icon.png     # source icon (from the upstream keiyoushi source)
  utils/
    <framework>/   # one folder per shared theme framework
      template.ts       # the shared extension implementation
      settings.ts       # base-URL override state + settings form
      forms.ts          # advanced-search form (when the framework supports it)
    url-builder/
      base.ts           # URL builder helper
      array-query-variant.ts
```

The Paperback bundler only treats a `src/` subfolder as a source when it
contains **both** `main.ts` and `pbconfig.ts`. Everything under `src/utils/` is
shared code and is ignored by the bundler, so a framework can be imported via a
relative path (e.g. `../utils/madara/template`).

### How a source is wired

Each source's `main.ts` is just a small config that instantiates its
framework's extension class:

```ts
import { ContentRating } from "@paperback/types";
import { MadaraExtension } from "../utils/madara/template";

export const ManhuaFast = new MadaraExtension({
  name: "ManhuaFast",
  baseUrl: "https://manhuafast.com",
  mangaSubString: "manga",
  useNewChapterEndpoint: false,
  contentRating: ContentRating.MATURE,
  langCode: "🇬🇧",
});
```

> **Important:** the exported `const` name **must exactly match the folder
> name** (which is the source id). The Paperback loader imports each source via
> a named import — `import { ManhuaFast } from "../ManhuaFast/main.js"` — so a
> mismatch makes the source fail to install.

Per-source options (e.g. `mangaSubString`, `useNewChapterEndpoint`, `apiUrl`,
`pageListSelector`, mirror lists) are ported from each upstream Kotlin source.
The shared template implements popular/latest discovery, search (with sorting +
advanced filters where supported), manga details, chapters, page lists,
lazy-image attribute fallbacks, status normalization, a per-source settings
form, and the Cloudflare challenge interceptor.

### Standalone sources

Many sources aren't built on a shared framework — they have a fully
self-contained `main.ts` that implements the Paperback interfaces directly.
These include the long-standing standalones (**LikeManga**, **Mangago**,
**WeebCentral**, **MangaPill**, **MangaFreak**, **MangaKatana**, **Manga Demon**,
**TCB Scans**, **Flame Comics**, **ReadComicOnline**, **AllManga**, **MangaGeko**,
**Batcave**, **MangaHere**, **AsuraScans**, **ComicK Fanmade**, **VyvyManga**,
**Temple Scan**, **ReadAllComics**, **MangaBolt**, **Manhwa18**, **Oppai Stream**,
**Comivex**, **MangaCloud**, **NineAnime**, **DFlowScans**,
**Honkai Impact 3rd**, **Clone Manga**, **The Duck Webcomics**, **Oglaf**), the
many **self-contained webcomics** (e.g. Gunnerkrigg Court, Questionable Content,
Schlock Mercenary, El Goonish Shive, Megatokyo, Kill Six Billion Demons,
Darths & Droids, Hiveworks Comics, Cyanide & Happiness, Vixen Logic,
Vision Haze), **HTML/JSON manga &
gallery sites** (e.g. MangaFox, Mangatown, Dynasty, InfinityScans, Vortex Scans,
NineHentai, MyHentaiGallery, Multporn, Doujins), the four single-consumer theme
ports (**Goda**, **The Blank**, **XOXO Comics**, **Rolia Scan**), and the
auth/DRM platforms listed under *Notes & Limitations*. See the **Available
Sources** table above for the full list.

## Building

Requirements: Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run tsc        # typecheck (tsc --noEmit)
npm run bundle     # produce ./bundles
npm run serve      # serve ./bundles locally for testing in the app
```

`npm run bundle` outputs one folder per source under `bundles/`, plus
`versioning.json` (the repository manifest) and `index.html`.

## Deployment

Pushing to the `0.9/stable` branch triggers the
`.github/workflows/bundle-deploy.yaml` GitHub Action, which bundles every source
and publishes `bundles/` to the `gh-pages` branch under `0.9/stable/`. GitHub
Pages then serves it at the install URL above.

## Versioning

Versions use a four-part scheme: **`1.4.<keiyoushi>.<internal>`**.

The first three components mirror the upstream keiyoushi version for each
source, so upstream changes stay detectable:

- **Theme (framework) sources:** `1.4.(baseVersionCode + overrideVersionCode)`,
  where each framework's `baseVersionCode` comes from
  `lib-multisrc/<framework>/build.gradle.kts` and the per-source
  `overrideVersionCode` comes from `src/en/<dir>/build.gradle`.
- **Standalone sources:** `1.4.(extVersionCode)`.

The fourth component is this repo's **internal revision**. Bump it (`.1` →
`.2` → …) whenever a template or a source's config changes **without** a
corresponding upstream change, so the app still surfaces the update to users.

To pick up upstream updates, re-pull the keiyoushi repo and recompute the
first three components for each source. Any source whose recomputed
keiyoushi number is higher than the one published here has changed upstream
and should be reviewed; reset its internal revision to `.1` when you do.

## Notes & Limitations

- Sources are generated from shared framework logic. Standard sites on a given
  framework behave the same way as that framework's reference source.
- The Madara framework now carries per-source override knobs (load-more browsing,
  custom chapter/list/detail/page selectors, `chapterUrlSuffix`,
  `filterNonMangaItems`, etc.) mirroring the upstream keiyoushi subclasses, and
  the ~30 Madara sites with genuinely custom Kotlin logic (e.g. Hiperdex,
  Manga18fx, HentaiRead, Manga District, Firescans' AES chapter
  protector, the year-inference date parsers) are reproduced as small
  `MadaraExtension` subclasses.
- The bespoke standalone (non-framework) keiyoushi **English** sources are now
  ported as well, so essentially the full English catalog (framework-based and
  standalone) is available. Multi-language (`src/all`) sources remain out of
  scope for now.
- **Next.js React-Server-Component (RSC) sites** are read by parsing the flight
  payload rather than the rendered DOM: the chunk/model reference resolver is
  reproduced in TypeScript and reused by **MangaK** (shared theme),
  **InfinityScans**, **J-Novel**, **Temple Scan** and **Valir Scans**. Details
  and page lists come straight out of the payload, and where a site only exposes
  pages through a Next.js *server action* (InfinityScans) the action id is posted
  directly. These ids and the sites' rotating slug hashes are cached in extension
  state and re-derived automatically when a request starts failing.
- The **MangaK** theme fetches its genre list from the site at runtime
  (`api.<host>/genres`) instead of hard-coding it. The list is cached in
  extension state, which is what lets the settings screen render the *Global
  Genre Blacklist* picker; open the browse filters once on a fresh install so the
  cache is populated.
- **DRM page-image decryption is implemented.** A source interceptor's
  `interceptResponse` transforms the raw image `ArrayBuffer`: pixel/cell/tile
  descrambles run in-process on Paperback's polyfilled canvas
  (shared helpers in `src/utils/descramble/canvas.ts`), byte
  ciphers run directly on the `Uint8Array`, and AES/RSA use `window.crypto.subtle`.
  These sources now decode their scrambled / encrypted pages for free or owned
  content: **Mangago** (grid descramble), **Omoi** (Azuki, XOR), **K Manga**
  (cell descramble), **VIZ** (EXIF grid unshuffle), **Comix** (tile descramble +
  byte-XOR), **Coolmic** (PBKDF2 + AES-CBC), **Philia Scans** (AES-CTR/ChaCha20 +
  tile unscramble), **emaqi** (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM), **Doujin.io - J18**
  (AES-ECB watermark patch composited over the page). HentaiNexus and Sunshine
  Butterfly encrypt only metadata (already handled), not image bytes.
  `Application.executeInWebView` is still used where a source's own JavaScript
  must run (e.g. Mangago's per-image descrambling-key derivation), not for the
  pixel work.
  WebCrypto has no ECB mode, so Doujin.io's AES-ECB layer is emulated with
  zero-IV CBC plus manual un-chaining (verified off-device against Node's
  `aes-128-ecb`/`aes-256-ecb`).
- **Canvas-polyfill caveat for tile remaps.** Paperback's in-process canvas
  polyfill does **not** reliably honour the 9-argument
  `drawImage(src, sx,sy,sw,sh, dx,dy,dw,dh)` source-crop form (the source
  sub-rectangle is ignored), and `getImageData`/`putImageData` apply an
  unreliable Y-axis origin that silently re-scrambles output. Tile cropping must
  therefore use only the 4-argument `drawImage(img, x, y, w, h)` form: draw the
  full image into a tile-sized scratch canvas shifted by `(-srcX0, -srcY0)` so
  only the wanted tile lands in bounds, then draw that scratch 1:1 to the
  destination position. **Comix** uses this technique; the Comix descramble math
  was validated off-device against a real scrambled page (seam-continuity
  reconstruction reproduced the page perfectly), proving the bug was the canvas
  primitive, not the permutation.
- **What still can't be bypassed is payment/login, not decryption.** Chapters a
  site refuses to serve to an anonymous/un-purchased account (most paid content on
  **K Manga**, **VIZ**, **Kodansha**, **Mangamo**, **WebNovel**, **J-Novel**,
  **BookWalker**, **Tapas**, **Coolmic**) return no bytes to decrypt, and
  **Madokami** needs HTTP Basic credentials. **The Blank**'s libsodium
  secretstream image layer (X25519 key-exchange + HMAC-signed URLs +
  XChaCha20-Poly1305 secretstream) is now fully reproduced in the runtime, so its
  images decrypt and render correctly. Browsing, search, details and chapter
  lists work for all of these.
- These extensions are **not affiliated** with the source websites. They only
  scrape publicly available pages.

```

**How to read:** All keiyoushi commits up to and including `LAST_REVIEWED_COMMIT`
have been evaluated against our sources. `LAST_APPLIED_COMMIT` is the newest
upstream commit that produced an actual code change here (AllManga page-list fix,
PR #18189). This review covered the 13 upstream commits since the previous
baseline. Most were out of scope: non-English sources (MangaTales `ar`,
RavenManga `es`, DGManga `uk`), multi-language (`src/all` MangaPlus), the
`hentaihand` theme and `ext-bootstrap`/`core` chores — none of which we ship.

What actually changed here:

- **AllManga** (`allanime` 25 → 26, PR #18189): the page-list capture hooks moved
  out of the post-load injection and into the served document `<head>`, so they
  are installed before the site's own bundle can read the chapter payload, and
  `iframe.contentWindow` is now forced to `null` on every element created through
  `createElement`/`createElementNS` to defeat the site's automation probe.
- **Weeb Central** (24 → 25, PR #18165): the `Origin` header is no longer sent
  (it made the site return mismatched thumbnails), and chapters whose title names
  a season ("Season 2 Chapter 5") are numbered by their position in the
  descending list instead of by the first number in the string, which previously
  collapsed every season onto the same chapter numbers. The commit's
  `scanlator` rework is not portable — Paperback's `Chapter` type has no
  scanlator field.
- **Doujin.io - J18** (3 → 4, PR #18164): **watermark removal implemented.** Each
  page JPEG hides an AES-ECB encrypted clean patch in a "MILF"-tagged APP10
  marker segment; the per-chapter key comes from `/api/mangas/{m}/{c}/chm` and is
  handed to the response interceptor through a private URL fragment (fragments
  are never transmitted, the same trick Mangago uses). Also adds the new
  `sort`/`sort_dir` search parameters as a sorting dropdown and the invisible
  chapter-title prefix that stops titles identical to the manga name from being
  trimmed to nothing.
- **One new port:** **Alpha Manga** (`alphamanga` 1, PR #18205) — `search.json` /
  `episodes.json` JSON endpoints with an HTML detail page, desktop UA for details
  and mobile UA for high-resolution pages, a Progress/Genres filter form and a
  *Hide locked chapters* setting. Locked chapters need a rental or purchase on
  the site and are marked 🔒. This brings the total to 418 sources.
- **HentaiRead.io** (PR #18178) was reviewed and needs **no change**: the diff is
  purely the ext-lib 1.6 (`KeiSource`) restructure with identical selectors and
  URLs, and its upstream `versionCode` is unchanged at 1.
